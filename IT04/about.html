    <h1>About</h1>
TCM, also known as The Clean Mile, is a subsidiary to the company 4Ocean. As is the case with its parent company, TCMs primary goal is to help the environment. Our aim is to help make travel greener. How, you ask? By having a standrad fare that pays for your transportation, but not your accomodation. When you arrive at your destination, you will check in, and register yourself at the TCM desk located within the premises. During your stay, you can join in on cleaning activities, missions, or simply deliver trash you have picked up to the TCM checkpoint. The more you participate, the lower your costs for accomodation will be. Using our strategy, our founders hope to get everyone to see the world, whil simultaneoulsly preserving it for future generations. The issue of planes and their waste has also come up, and we admit that we haven't yet found a 100% green solution. We do have a capable board of engineers who work everyday in order to better the world. We also participate in climate summits whenever they are organized.

Even if you do not travel, you can donate to either TCM or 4Ocean. All donations, no matter how big or small, help out. With the funds we receive, we buy new equipment for efficiency and comfort for our guests. We hope we'll see you there!

    <h4>Bali</h4>
    <p>Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. Bali is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy. Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 82.5% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism. It is also renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award. Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<h2>4Ocean</h2>
4Ocean has already cleared hundreds of beaches, and has pulled massive amounts of plastic from the oceans. Many would be contented with the work the organisation has already done, but we want to go beyond what a normal movement does.
We want to help people see the world, while at the same time saving it. Our founders believe that you truly have to see the Earth for yourself to see how you can help it. That's why this subsidiary company was founded in 2017.
Therefore, this new branch of the organisation strives to reduce traveling costs, while still helping the environment. 4Ocean helps this project by lending funds adn getting more people involved. By cleaning up the places we visit,
we can make their natural beauty last longer. As we are still a private company, it will take some time for us to get more engineers on board to help design greener ways to travel. Every donation made to either organisation helps.
We hope to see you soon!
